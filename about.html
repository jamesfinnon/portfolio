                    I attended school at St John's RC Academy in Perth. As this was an all through school, I have been
                    there from nursery right through to S6, with my year group being the first to move through every
                    year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During this period, I managed to achieve 7 National 5s, 6 Highers and 3 Advanced Highers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In S6 I was part of the Pupil Leadership Team, being deputy head boy. This involved helping with
                    large school events, as well as pushing for changes within the school to help better it for pupils
                    and staff.

                    I am currently attending the University of Dundee, where I am in my first year of a Computing
                    Science degree. In the future, this degree includes the oppertunity of a year in industry, which I
                    am very much looking forward to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So far, I have started to learn a new programming language, Java, as well as developing my skills in
                    web development and python.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This year has already provided me with my first experience with a unix based system, which was a
                    slight challenge at first but a welcome addition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is my hope that this degree will provide me with a strong foundation in computing science, as
                    well as the skills and experience needed to pursue a career in the tech industry, whatever that may
                    entail at the time of graduation.

                    Currently, I work part time at Gloagburn Farm Shop, which is a local farm shop in Perth. I have been
                    working there since mid 2024, helping to serve customers, stock shelves and keep the shop tidy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have really enjoyed working there, as it has given me a lot of experience in customer service and working in a team.

                    Outside of school, I haved played tennis for 14 years, at Perth Lawn Tennis Club. Over this time, I
                    have competed in a number of Club Championships, as well as representing the club in leagues at both
                    junior and senior level.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For around 3 years, I have helped out with coaching at the club, at both the weekly junior coaching
                    sessions, as well as the major camps which run across the school holidays.

                    I have also played the clarinet for 8 years, from Primary 6 through to S6. Over this time I have
                    performed many times individually at school showcases and events, as well as part of the school
                    orchestra.

                <p>
                    During this time, I have also been a member of Perth Wind Ensemble, then Perth Wind Orchestra, and
                    finally Perth Youth Orchestra. This involved performing at a number of concerts across Perth, as
                    well as a few events in Edinburgh as part of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.
