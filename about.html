                I attended school at St John's RC Academy in Perth. As this was an all through school, I have been there from nursery right through to S6, with my year group being the first to move through every year.
            </p>
            <p> 
                During this period, I managed to achieve 7 National 5s, 6 Highers and 3 Advanced Highers. I also was a part of the Pupil Leadership Team, being a deputy head. 
            </p>
            <h2 class="h4 mt-4">University</h2>
            <hr class="bg-secondary">
            <p>
                I am currently attending the University of Dundee, where I am in my first year of a Computing Science degree. In the future, this degree includes the oppertunity of a year in industry, which I am very much looking forward to.
            </p>

                Currently, I work part time at Gloagburn Farm Shop, which is a local farm shop in Perth. I have been working there since mid 2024, helping to serve customers, stock shelves and keep the shop tidy. I have really enjoyed working there, as it has given me a lot of experience in customer service and working in a team.
            </p>
            <h2 class="h4 mt-4">Extra Activities</h2>

            <p>
                Outside of school, I played tennis for 13 years, competing for Perth Tennis Club in both junior and senior leagues. I have also helped out at the club as a coach for the younger players, mostly at the camps which take place over the school holidays.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have also played the clarinet for 8 years, completing a grade 5 exam, as well as performing as part of Perth Youth Orchestra across a number of concerts.
