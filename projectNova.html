        <h1 class="display-4 mb-4">Project Nova</h1>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Project Nova is a battleship-like guessing game implemented in Java, designed to challenge
            players' logic and strategy skills.</p>
        <h2 class="h4 mt-4">Background</h2>
        <hr class="bg-secondary">
        <p>Project Nova is a guessing game where you take turns with either another player or the computer, guessing the
            location of creatures on a grid. On each guess, you may uncover, creatures, traps, powerups and sinkholes,
            each of which will add an element of unpredictability to the game.</p>
        <p>This was made as part of CS11002, and was my final project for the module.</p>
        <h2 class="h4 mt-4">Creating and Starting the Game</h2>
        <hr class="bg-secondary">
        <p>When initially launching the program, the game grid will appear, but is unusable until a new game is created,
            or a game is loaded. If a new game is created, the program will first ask if you would like to play the
            computer, or another player. The program will then ask for the users name(s), and update the scoreboard with
            the relevant information.</p>
        <h2 class="h4 mt-4">Playing the Game</h2>
        <hr class="bg-secondary">
        <h3 class="h5 mt-3">Basic Premise</h3>
        <p>In a multiplayer game, the players will take turns guessing the locations of creatures. If they guess
            correctly, they gain 5 points, and take another turn. If playing against the computer, the player will take
            their turn, and the computer will automatically make their guess. The player with the points when all
            creatures have been found is deemed to be the winner.</p>

                        <p>As already mentioned, the game runs through a graphical user interface. This means the user
                            can click
                            on the tile they would like to guess, and the game will reveal the tile through colours and
                            popup
                            messages. In fact, all inputs and outputs are done through this GUI, and nothing is received
                            or sent
                            by the console. This allows for a seamless user experience, as everything is right in front
                            of you.

                        <h4 class="h6 mt-3">Complex Creatures</h4>
                        <p>Creatures are not just single square objects, but rather, span across multiple squares, in
                            all
                            different shapes in sizes. The game contains 10 types of creatures, and each one will spawn
                            once per
                            game, in a random location and orientation. When clicked, a creature cell will turn either
                            green or
                            blue, depending on the player that found it. When a player reveals the last square of a
                            creature,
                            the entire creature will turn pink, and said player is awarded an additional 5 points</p>

                            traps.
                            If a players health reaches zero at any point, they immediately lose.</p>

                        <h4 class="h6 mt-3">Booby Traps</h4>
                        <p>There are three types of booby traps: sea mines, bombfish, and kelp. Each trap will generate
                            a random
                            amount of times, in random locations on the grid. Sea mines will make the player lose 20hp,
                            bombfish
                            will make the player lose 10 points, and kelp will tangle the player, making them lose a
                            turn. When
                            clicked, the program will notify the user of what trap they have discovered, its effect, and
                            its
                            square on the grid will be coloured in red.</p>

                        <h4 class="h6 mt-3">Power Ups</h4>
                        <p>There are three types of powerups: Health boosts, extra turns, and the reveal. Health boosts
                            and
                            extra turns are fairly self-explanatory, providing 20hp, and a bonus turn respectively. The
                            reveal
                            on the other hand is a bit more fancy. It will reveal the location of a random creature cell
                            on the
                            grid. This is especially useful for finding those tricky small creatures, when all the big
                            ones have
                            been found. Like traps, when clicked the program will notify the user of the power up and
                            its
                            effect. The associated square on the grid will also be coloured in white.</p>

                        <h4 class="h6 mt-3">Sinkholes</h4>
                        <p>Completing the trifecta of the additional elements is the sinkhole. This special square will
                            act as
                            though the user who found the sinkhole has activated all neighbouring 8 cells. This includes
                            gaining
                            score from creatures, and also power ups! What makes sinkholes dangerous however, is they
                            can also
                            activate traps. When multiple sinkholes are in close proximity, this can start a chain
                            reaction, for
                            better or for worse. When found, sinkholes are coloured in black.</p>

                            start of
                            each turn. If it runs out, play immediately switches to the other user. This is more to

                        <p>As mentioned previously, at the start of the game, the user has the option to play against
                            the
                            computer. This computer is fairly stupid, basically blind guessing random squares across the
                            board.
                            A more intelligent version was considered, however for a simple prototype game, it was
                            deemed too
                            complicated. This version does work however, and provides a reasonable oppent, especially

        <h2 class="h4 mt-4">Design Considerations</h2>
        <hr class="bg-secondary">
        <h3 class="h5 mt-3">Time Limit - Penalty</h3>
        <p>Initially, I considered adding a harsher penalty for running out of time, such as losing health or score. But
            turns are so powerful in this game, as an opponent could go on a run of guessing multiple creature squares
            in a row, making losing your turn in my mind a fitting punishment.</p>
        <h3 class="h5 mt-3">Mega Guess</h3>
        <p>The game brief suggested the implementation of a 'mega guess,' which when clicked would reveal all squares
            around it. This was considered to be added as a powerup, that the user could choose to use at any point.
            However, a more interesting and simpler idea was added instead. The sinkhole. Although not outlined in the
            mega guess, the sinkhole to me was more engaging if it acted as a player click, which activated traps and
            powerups. A fun quirk of this was sinkhole chain reactions, which can be extremely rewarding or devastating
            depending on the context.</p>
        <h3 class="h5 mt-3">Hints</h3>
        <p>A competitive two player game to me didn't warrant the inclusion of hints. So instead, a similar effect was
            achieved through the reveal powerup. This, like a hint, revealed one creature coordinate. This is especially
            powerful for the smaller creatures, which can be hard to get a start on. In my opinion, this was a much more
            natural inclusion of a mechanism to help the players locate creatures, and was simple enough to implement.
