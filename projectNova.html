            <p>Project Nova is a guessing game where you take turns with either another player or the computer,
                guessing the
                location of creatures on a grid. On each guess, you may uncover, creatures, traps, powerups and
                sinkholes,
                each of which will add an element of unpredictability to the game.</p>
            <p>This was made as part of CS11002, and was my final project for the module.</p>

            <hr class="bg-secondary">
            <p>When initially launching the program, the game grid will appear, but is unusable until a new game is
                created,
                or a game is loaded. If a new game is created, the program will first ask if you would like to play
                the
                computer, or another player. The program will then ask for the users name(s), and update the
                scoreboard with
                the relevant information.</p>

            <h3 class="h5 mt-3">Basic Premise</h3>
            <p>In a multiplayer game, the players will take turns guessing the locations of creatures. If they guess
                correctly, they gain 5 points, and take another turn. If playing against the computer, the player
                will take
                their turn, and the computer will automatically make their guess. The player with the points when
                all
                creatures have been found is deemed to be the winner.</p>

                                <p>As already mentioned, the game runs through a graphical user interface. This means
                                    the user
                                    can click on the tile they would like to guess, and the game will reveal the tile
                                    through colours and
                                    popup messages. In fact, all inputs and outputs are done through this GUI, and
                                    nothing is received
                                    or sent by the console. This allows for a seamless user experience, as everything is
                                    right in front
                                    of you.

                                <p>As mentioned previously, at the start of the game, the user has the option to play
                                    against
                                    the computer. This computer is fairly stupid, basically blind guessing random
                                    squares across the
                                    board. A more intelligent version was considered, however for a simple prototype
                                    game, it was
                                    deemed too complicated. This version does work however, and provides a reasonable
                                    oppent, especially
                                    for a new player.</p>

            <!--horizontal line for section separation-->
            <hr class="bg-secondary">

            <h3 class="h5 mt-3">Time Limit - Penalty</h3>
            <p>Initially, I considered adding a harsher penalty for running out of time, such as losing health or score.
                But
                turns are so powerful in this game, as an opponent could go on a run of guessing multiple creature
                squares
                in a row, making losing your turn in my mind a fitting punishment.</p>

            <h3 class="h5 mt-3">Mega Guess</h3>
            <p>The game brief suggested the implementation of a 'mega guess,' which when clicked would reveal all
                squares
                around it. This was considered to be added as a powerup, that the user could choose to use at any point.
                However, a more interesting and simpler idea was added instead. The sinkhole. Although not outlined in
                the
                mega guess, the sinkhole to me was more engaging if it acted as a player click, which activated traps
                and
                powerups. A fun quirk of this was sinkhole chain reactions, which can be extremely rewarding or
                devastating
                depending on the context.</p>

            <h3 class="h5 mt-3">Hints</h3>
            <p>A competitive two player game to me didn't warrant the inclusion of hints. So instead, a similar effect
                was
                achieved through the reveal powerup. This, like a hint, revealed one creature coordinate. This is
                especially
                powerful for the smaller creatures, which can be hard to get a start on. In my opinion, this was a much
                more
                natural inclusion of a mechanism to help the players locate creatures, and was simple enough to
                implement.
